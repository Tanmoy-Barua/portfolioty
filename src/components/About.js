    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    As a software engineer intern at Zifatech Solutions, I code and develop high-performance websites and applications using JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and other technologies. I collaborate with team members, test and debug code, document processes, research new technologies, problem-solve, and adapt to changing requirements. I also adhere to ethical standards and professionalism in my interactions.

    <p>
    I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from University of Science and Technology Chittagong, where I was awarded the best project/thesis for developing sql-sanitizer, an NPM package that safeguards against SQL injection attacks, amassing over 500 downloads. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Westcliff University, where I continue to explore and learn new skills and concepts in web development. I am passionate about creating seamless, user-friendly web experiences and eager to leverage my expertise in a dynamic role. Let's connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team's success!
